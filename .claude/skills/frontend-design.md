# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of **distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces** that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose** - What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone** - Pick an extreme direction:
   - Brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
3. **Constraints** - Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation** - What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Requirements

Code should be:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography
- **AVOID**: Generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto, Space Grotesk, system fonts
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Consider: Playfair Display, DM Serif, Archivo, Sora, Plus Jakarta Sans

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- **AVOID**: Clichéd color schemes (especially purple gradients on white)

### Motion
- CSS-only solutions preferred
- Use Motion library for React when available
- One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals > scattered micro-interactions
- Focus on high-impact moments: scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth (never flat solid colors)
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## Critical Rules

**NEVER USE:**
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

**ALWAYS PRIORITIZE:**
- Context-specific character
- Intentional design choices
- Execution precision matching complexity to vision
- Each design should be distinctly tailored
- Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- Minimalist designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing

> Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back - show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
